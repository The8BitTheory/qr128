; qr-code generator
; parameters:
; - reads the location of the string to be encoded from a zeropage location (eg $fb/$fc)
;   the string must be zero-terminated (that saves us the need to provide string-length as a parameter)
; - bank of the string address
; returns: index of sprite-location, written to location of input parameter (64 byte intervals)

; this is the version for the mega65 introdisk #4
; it renders to sprite data and parameters required might be different to other use-cases

; example:
; poke $fb,00:poke $fc,$7c : rem input string location $7c00 
; poke $fd,$f0:poke $fe,$01: rem output sprite index $01f0 (496 dec -> 31744 in bank 0)
; SYS qr,0,$fb,$fd : rem read input string from bank 0, $fb-$fc, and write to sprite-index

!cpu m65

target = "mega65"



; SYS maps $E000-$FFFF to the MEGA65 KERNAL (3.E000-3.FFFF),
; $2000-$7FFF to 0.2000-0.7FFF, and leaves $0000-$1FFF and $8000-$DFFF "unmapped."

; This allows $C000-$CFFF and $D000-$DFFF to fall through to INTERFACE and VIC registers, respectively
; and $8000-$BFFF to fall through to bank 0 RAM.

*= $7000
  ; 196-203 ($c4-$cb) are rs232 input- and output buffer start and end addresses
  ; these are free to use, as long as rs232 is not used
