# QR-Code Generator for Commodore VIC-20,C64,C128,Mega65,X16

The code is still a mess.
The Basic implementations are those with "driver" in the name (qrdriver20, qrdriverx16, qrdriverm65, ...)

For the Assembly version, take qr.a and all the files that are referred as !source references inside.

## Available versions
C64: Basic and ML
C128: Basic and ML
VIC-20: Basic and reduced ML

Mega65: Basic
X16: Basic

I didn't yet manage to handle screen output on the X16 and the Mega65 in Assembly Language, that's why I just stuck to Basic versions for these for the time being.

But with this being Open Source, I'm looking forward to your input and/or contributions :-)

Either way: if you find this useful for your projects, I'd love to hear about it.

Have fun!
